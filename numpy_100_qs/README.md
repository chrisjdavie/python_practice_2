Working through the questions at 

https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100

The process is this - go through all the questions, keep track of which ones I can do and which I couldn't. If I can't do it, repeat the example 3 times to memorise it, move to the next one. 

Once I've done that, pass through the ones I didn't get right again time, with the process as above.

Each pass through is in a folder labeled 'pass_N', where N is the pass
